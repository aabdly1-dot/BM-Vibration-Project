# 📚 BM-Vibration Project: Literature Study & State-of-the-Art

The articles below are organized by your project's main priorities and technical challenges, directly supporting the work of Team A (App) and Team B (Algorithm).

---

## 1. Priority 1: Measuring Exposure Time ("On/Off" Classifier)

Your "first and most important aim is the timing", to create an "on/off classifier". These articles address that core problem.

* **"Hand-arm vibration exposure monitoring with wearable sensor module"**
    * **Why it is relevant:** This study evaluates a "wearable wireless... sensor module" to estimate "vibration exposure and **exposure time**." This directly aligns with the core of your "Priority 1". It is available on ResearchGate and SINTEF's portal.

## 2. Priority 2: Tool Classification (with FFT)

Your second goal is to "categorize" the signal to "identify which of the 3 tools is being used", likely using FFT.

* **"AGIS: Automated Tool Detection & Hand-Arm Vibration Estimation using an unmodified Smartwatch"**
    * **Why it is relevant:** This is a direct hit for **Team B (Signal & Algorithm)**. It describes a system that "learns and recognizes tools" based on their "vibration patterns." It explicitly mentions using "Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT)" on data from an accelerometer to "identify the tool." The whole article appears to be available online.
* **"Vibration Exposure for Selected Power Hand Tools Used in Automobile Assembly"**
    * **Why it is relevant:** This article confirms your methodology. It uses "fast Fourier transform (FFT) spectral analyzers" and states that different tools (rotary and reciprocating) have "large distinct dominant fundamental frequencies." This is the scientific basis for your "Classifier v2". It is available on ResearchGate.

## 3. Main Technical Challenge: Sensor Placement & "Transfer Function"

A central part of your project is to place the sensor on the "outside of the hand" and understand the "transfer function" from the grip to the back of the hand.

* **"Advancing Accessible Hand-Arm Vibration Safety Monitoring: ISO-Compliance with Wearable Sensors and Transfer Functions"**
    * **Why it is relevant:** This article, found on arXiv, is extremely relevant. It investigates "wearable sensor-based data collection" and develops an "error-minimization **transfer function**" to "map vibration data across sensor positions." This is exactly the concept from the "previous PCC report" that your project is building upon.
