# Meeting Summary: Ethical Analysis (Nov 5, 2025)

## 📝 Meeting Summary

This was a short planning meeting (approx. 30 minutes) between the four team members (Ibrahim, Giovanni, Mostafa, and Roman). The purpose was to review and divide the work for the **"Ethical Analysis: BM-Vibration Project"** document, which is due on Friday.

You went through the proposed document structure and assigned sections to each team member. You also discussed the scope of the project, confirming that it is **"just for research"** for now. At the same time, you agreed that the ethical analysis must also account for a future **"commercial"** use, which would require stricter rules for handling personal information.

## 🎯 Goals Discussed (for the document)

You confirmed the main ethical goals (or themes) that your analysis paper will cover. These are:

1.  **Safety:**
    * This was identified as the top priority.
    * This section will cover the handling of **Information**, **Personal information**, and **GDPR** compliance.

2.  **Company Awareness:**
    * This section will address the major ethical risks from a company's perspective, specifically:
    * **Surveillance:** The risk of the app being misused by a company to monitor workers beyond just vibration (e.g., tracking breaks).
    * **Economy:** The business implications and potential for the data to be used in a commercial context.

3.  **App (Purpose & Scope):**
    * You clarified that the app's current purpose is **"just for research"**.
    * You agreed that you must **"update the ethical rules"** to include the possibility of the app moving **"from research to commercial"** use later on.

4.  **Classification and Accuracy:**
    * You noted this as a key section. This is linked to the ethical risk of the algorithm being wrong (False Positives or False Negatives) and the real-world safety impact this would have.

## 📋 Team Assignments for the Document

You divided the sections of the ethical analysis as follows:

* **1. Introduction & 4. Conclusion:** Ibrahim
* **2. Identification of Ethical Issues (All sub-sections):** Roman and Giovanni
* **3. Proposed Mitigations (How We Will Address These Issues):** Mostafa
